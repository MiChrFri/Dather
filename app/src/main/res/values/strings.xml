            <h1>TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN</h1>
            <h1>INFORMATION SHEET FOR PROSPECTIVE PARTICIPANTS</h1>
            <p>A research to identify and analyze influences on the learning quality of writing computer software.
            Within this research we try to identify and analyse influences on the learning quality of writing computer software.</p>
<br>
            <h2>Context of research</h2>
            <p>Learning how to program and thinking like a programmer can be a very different process
            for different people. It seems that some students have more problems and struggles than
            others. Also more experienced programmers sometimes write better code and sometimes create
            less quality. This dissertation investigates metrics of environmental influences in the
            cognitive processes which are responsible for the code quality and performance in the
            process of software developing. The programming skills are measured by automated code
            analysis software and then correlated with gathered data during the development process.
            The built in sensors and of the participants mobile phone such as the location, microphone,
            accelerometers etc. are being used to gather information about the environment and context.
            Therefore it is required for the participants to install and start the provided android
            application on their device.</p>
<br>
            <h2>Benefits for the participants</h2>
            <p>The participants will get feedback and information about their individual results and
            the code quality compared to other participants. They can also request the results of
            this study and the influencing factors in the quality of the results. This knowledge can
            help to increase their own code quality and optimise their working environment. </p>
<br>
            <h2>The procedure of this study</h2>
            <p>Each participant needs to install the data gathering application on their cellular
            devices will explicitly asked to allow the application to collect the relevant data.
            Afterwards the information sheet for prospective participants will be displayed within
            the application. In order to go on, the user need to confirm that he/she understood the
            information and agrees to the procedure.
            Starting the gathering process in the app will trigger a periodically collection of data
            until the user stops the process.  Beside the gathering process, no data will be collected.
            After working on programming projects, the participants may be asked to answer some
            additional questions through the application. After completing and submitting the gathered
            data, the participant can uninstall the application, which deletes all the gathered data.
            A deinstallation also resets the permissions for application which means that the participant
            needs to set the permissions again after reinstalling the application.
            The user is required to upload the programming code on Github and grant access to the working
            repository in order to do the analysis.</p>
<br>
            <h2>The expected duration of the participants involvement</h2>
            <p>First, the participant needs to download the app and initially enter information about
            person, university and experience. Before starting the programming task, the student needs
            to open the application and log the start time. After the submission the app asks the
            participant additional occasional questions. The estimated time for the initial setup is
            not more than 5 minutes. Afterwards the data is constantly being gathered during the
            development process. The submission of the particular datasets after the gathering takes
            less than a minute. </p>
<br>
            <h2>Data to be gathered</h2>
            <p>In order to find correlations between the code quality and environmental influences,
            we need to gather as many information about the environment as possible. We want to detect
            the ambient noise by using the microphone of the mobile phone. We will only save the noise
            value without audio files. None of the cameras will be used for collecting photos or videos,
            neither will we access any private data from the users mobile device.
            We will also collect motion information about the mobile device itself, the data from its
            light sensor. In order to collect additional information about the environment, we gather
            the location and current time of the mobile device which we could use to get the local
            weather information. Some devices have additional sensors for detecting environmental
            information such as temperature or humidity that we also might use in this study. </p>
<br>
            <h2>Usage of gathered data</h2>
            <p>The data is exclusively used to for this study and will not be provided to anyone else
            then the research team. The data will be used to create behaviour models and identify
            interesting patterns. (e.g. We expect to find correlations between exigent tasks and loud
            noise in the working environment). The collected data during the study will be anonymised
            and the transmission over the internet will exclusively be in an encrypted form and just
            used for statistical analysis purpose. The data will also  be stored encrypted and a not
            traceable identifier will be used to keep the data anonymous.
            Participants can be assured they will not be mentioned by name or any other unique
            identifier and their data will be handled with the most possible discretion. We also
            guarantee no direct quotations and contextual appropriateness.</p>
<br>
            <h2>Rights of the participant</h2>
            <p>Every participant has the right to withdraw and to omit the individual collected data,
            without penalty. A requested withdraw would  lead to deletion of the entire data of the
            participant which was collected related to that study. Participants also have the
            provision to receive an individual debriefing after participation. The participant has
            the right to request a digital copy of the dissertation after its completion.</p>
